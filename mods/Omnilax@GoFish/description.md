- Go Fish mod that adds 3 Booster packs that as you to select a card in hand and creates a random joker.
- Adds 80 unique "Fish" Jokers that can be created from these packs, fish jokers do not take up joker slots but can be hard to catch!
- Also adds 2 vouchers that make it easier to find the card you are looking for while opening a pack.

This is my first mod, and its not so polished but please let me know any suggestions or bugs!
