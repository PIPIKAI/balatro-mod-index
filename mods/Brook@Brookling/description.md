# ABOUT

Hey friends! I’m Brookling.

Since the release of Balatro in February 2024, I’ve been playing this game and absolutely love it.
These days I mainly focus on Gold Stake win streaks, with a PB of 18.

From February to August 2025, I dedicated myself to creating a high-quality, vanilla-like mod,
drawing a lot of inspiration from many existing mods (which I’ll recommend later) and feeling
deeply grateful to their creators.

I designed 15 new Jokers, each with unique abilities across a wide range of types, putting a lot of
effort into balance, fun, and innovation — and illustrating all the cards myself.

Special thanks to Baimao for coding this project, and to all the friends who supported it.
Brook is now released and ready to play!
