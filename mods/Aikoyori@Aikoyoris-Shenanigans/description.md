Basically a content mod where I add whatever I feel like adding.

The thumbnail is not doing this mod's justice because there are way more than what's there.

## What does it have?

This mod features (as of time writing this)
- 50+ Jokers and!
- At least three unique new mechanics never before seen in Balatro!
- Literally play Scrabble in Balatro
- 11 Planet Cards and at least 25 consumables (I ain't putting the exact numbers)!
- Two Balance Mode for either a Balanced experience or Maximum numbers
- 30+ Boss Blinds
- 10+ Card Enhancements
- 4 Decks
- Hardcore Challenge Mode (for those looking to test their mod set)
- A lot of cross-mod content! (I am looking for more cross-mod)
- More to come!

## What, what?
Yes, that's right, this mod features a "Balance" system (which is basically just Cryptid gameset in disguise) 
where you can pick the number you want to play with depending on your mood!

> Note: Absurd Balance (the likes of Cryptid) requires [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman) to be installed. Talisman is not essential if you want to play Adequate (Vanilla) Balance

## But...
That's not it. This mod features a bunch of cross-mod content already from the likes of More Fluff, Card Sleeves, Partners, and more!

## I haven't even said a thing yet
Oh.

## I wanted to ask if I can spell swear words when playing the so called Scrabble?
That's for you to find out! Download now!

## What if I have more questions?
Feel free to ask in [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JVg8Bynm7k) for the mod or open an issue!
