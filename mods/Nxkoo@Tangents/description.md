# Tangents
 Shenanigans and Randomness had a hot steamy intimate time.

# ABOUT THIS MOD
Once upon a time, a **LEGEND** was whispered among us.

It was a **LEGEND** of **CRYPTID**.

It was a **LEGEND** of ~ALMANAC~ **ENTROPY**.

It was a **LEGEND** of **BUNCO**.

It was a **LEGEND** of **EXTRA CREDITS**.

This is the legend of **TANGENTS**.

For millenia, **UNBALANCED** and **VANILLA+** have lived in *balance*,
Bringing peace to the *LOVELY STEAM*.
But if this harmony were to shatter...

a terrible conflict would occur.

The background will run grey with t**ERROR**.

And the instance will crash with 50+ Mods installed.

Then, her heart pierced...
**BALATRO** will draw her final hands.
Only then, shining with *polychrome*...

Three **HEROES** appear at **MODDING CHAT**.

AN **ARTIST**,

A **CODER**,

And a **CLUELESS PERSON WHO NEEDS HELP WITH THEIR GAME CRASHING**.

Only they can seal the crash logs
And banish the **TABLE'S COMPARISON**.
Only then will balance be restored,
And **BALATRO** saved from destruction.
Today, the **FOUNTAIN OF SHITPOST**-
The geyser that gives this land form-
Stands tall at the center of the BMM.
But recently, another fountain has appeared on the horizon...
And with it, the balance of **VANILLA+** and **UNBALANCED** begins to shift... 

it's a shitpost mod if you cant tell, has around 90+ Jokers, more to come really soon!
